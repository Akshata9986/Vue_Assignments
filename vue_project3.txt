1==>

<Keep Alive>
---------------
 a component will be unmounted when it is switched away from that component. 
 We can force the inactive components to stay "alive" with the built-in <KeepAlive> component.

2==>
scope in style
-----------------
When a <style> tag has the scoped attribute, its CSS will apply to elements of the current component only. 
This is similar to the style encapsulation found in Shadow DOM.

3==>
code splitting
-----------------
Code splitting is where a tool splits the application bundle into multiple smaller chunks, which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel.
